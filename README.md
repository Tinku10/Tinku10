## Good seeing you here ✧˖°.

I'm Tinku. I am a software engineer, mostly self-taught. I didn't know I enjoyed computers. Heck, I didn't even know what was taught in a computer class back in my school days, and always thought whatever that was would be *boring (for a lack of better word)*.

Now, almost half a decade later, I am working passionately in this domain. I am very enthusiastic about the computer fundamentals that led me to explore much of what I know today. Quite interesting how your belief changes over time. It's fascinating how we can achieve our vision quite *"easily"* in this domain, contrary to the other fields. Imagination is really the limit here. I believe that we can stretch quite a long road ahead of us with a car filled with fun and imagination.

Anyway, go on, and explore some of the work I have done here. You can expect some *fresh-out-of-the-oven* stuff from time to time. But the stuff lying here is nicely refrigerated too!
